## Features
- User-friendly interface for generating SQL queries.
- Execution of generated SQL queries against a database.
- Display of query results in a tabular format.
- Data visualization of query results.
- Option to edit visualization parameters and update the graph accordingly.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SQLAlchemy
- LangChain
- LIDA

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ripperox/SQL_Chatbot.git
    cd SQL_Chatbot
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
